	<h1>Generalized Boosted Regression Modeling</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Fits generalized boosted regression models</p>
	<h2>Details</h2>
	<p>This package implements the generalized boosted modeling framework. Boosting is the process
	of iteratively adding basis functions in a greedy fashion so that each additional basis function further
	reduces the selected loss function. This implementation closely follows Friedmanâ€™s Gradient
	Boosting Machine (Friedman, 2001).</p>
	<p>In addition to many of the features documented in the Gradient Boosting Machine, gbm offers additional
	features including the out-of-bag estimator for the optimal number of iterations, the ability to
	store and manipulate the resulting gbm object, and a variety of other loss functions that had not previously
	had associated boosting algorithms, including the Cox partial likelihood for censored data,
	the poisson likelihood for count outcomes, and a gradient boosting implementation to minimize the
	AdaBoost exponential loss function.</p>
	<p>gbm.fit provides the link between R and the C++ gbm engine. gbm is a front-end to gbm.fit
	that uses the familiar R modeling formulas. However, model.frame is very slow if there are many
	predictor variables. For power-users with many variables use gbm.fit. For general practice gbm is
	preferable.</p>
